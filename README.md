# Stock Analysis With VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a code that we already created in Module 2 in order to make the code look cleaner and work more efficiently. We were tasked with collecting certain stock informations from the years 2017 and 2018 in order to help Steve help his parents make smarter investments. 
## Data Provided
The data provided included two charts with 12 different stock values over the years 2017 and 2018. The stock information given was the ticker symbol, the date the stock was issued, the Open and CLose price, the highs and lows of the day, the adjusted close value, and the volume it was traded during that day. The goal of our project was to retrieve the Total Daily Volume throughout the year, the correct ticker symbol, and the total return percentage if you were to buy that stock on the first day of the year and hold it until the end.
