# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
								Analysis of Module 1 Project

### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to determine if there was a correlation between the ammount of money raised and the date
in which the fundraisers took place, specifically the theater type fundraisers, and as well as if there was a correlation
between outcomes based on how high the funding goals were set. In order to do so, we must isolate the variables our
data gave us, such as the date, number of successful outcomes, failed outcomes, and canceled outcomes. We also had to
filter through the subcategories and create charts to be able to visually see any patterns. Our main goal was to help Louise
see if there were any improvements she could make in the way she plans out her fundraising events. Whether it be the dates
of the events, specifically theater events, or if she should reel in her expectations on how much she is looking to raise
per event. 

## Analysis and Challenges
During the analysis, formatting the charts/graphs in order to show off relevant information was tough. Having to change the
axis in order to properly show the viewer what I was trying to show off took a little time to figure out. Also figuring out
that the '$' key allows you to lock in your column set helped me when copying and pasting my cells in the outcomes based on
goals challenge. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the analysis of outcomes based on launch dates, you can see in the graph that her most successful theater fundraising 
events happened around the summer time. That could be becuase kids are on summer vacation, and families are more likely to
go out and watch a theater performance when their kids are off school. Also depending on the location, weather could have 
played a factor. If it is nice outside, more people are likely to take a walk and fall upon activities. So if Louise plans
more fundraising events in the summer time, she should be able to see an increase in her funding, as opposed to planning things
in the winter/cold period of time. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Looking at just the graph on the sheet, you can see that as the goal amount increases, the percentage of successful outcomes
declines, while the percentage of failed outcomes increases. That can be attributed to a lot of factors, but it could help
shouw Louise that managing her expectations in the future can help her allocate her resources/time more efficiently. Instead 
of hoping that 1 big event could make her a lot of money, she can use that time to plan a few small ones that will have a higher
chance of raising her goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Filtering the Pivot table Fields can get confusing, knowing what data you are trying to combine can get confusing with a
large data set. The best way I got around it was just plugging in the data I knew we were comparing into the different fields,
and seeing how the chart reacted. Also with copying and pasting your formulas into new cells, knowing things like '$' locked
your data set helps you save a lot of time in manually changing each cells formula. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The summer time was the best time to have theater fundrasing events.(Weather and summer vacation may play a big factor)
She was sble to maintain a low number of canceled events.(Hosting a theter fundraiser event usually goes smoothly)

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal number, the higher the liklihood it is to reach the goal. (Raising a lot of money is hard)
Managing expectations moving forward can give her a more accurate budget to plan for in the future, she had a lot of fundraisers
have less than %50 success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I think knowing weather conditions might be able to give us more insight on our conclusions. Also knowing the city/state
that some of the events were held in could allow us more insight on where the best place for funding is. The cost of the events
in order to see our net profits that would ultimately go into her play would help as well. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table showing how much was raised in each country, or how successful each subcategory was overall.
